##Welcome, fellow internaut!

I'm Moritz and I like [programming]({{ site.author.github }}), traveling and [photography](/photography.html).

A student by day, I spend my evenings experimenting with different languages and technologies. When not installed in front of a computer, I love to travel, preferably in a way that lets me escape civilization or explore and experience different cultures. Some impressions from my last trips can be found on my steadily growing [flickr archive]({{ site.author.flickr }}).

Lastly, I am an avid reader and have started to keep a briefly annotated [list](/readinglist.html).
