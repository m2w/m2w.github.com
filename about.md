<h2>Welcome, fellow internaut!</h2>

I'm Moritz. I enjoy [programming]({{ site.author.github }}), traveling and [photography](/photography.html).

Student by day, I spend most of my evenings programming, preferably experimenting with new technologies. When not installed in front of a computer, I love to travel, preferably in a way that lets me escape civilization and/or explore and experience new cultures. Some impressions can be found on my growing [flickr archive]({{ site.author.flickr }}).

Lastly, I am an avid reader. I keep a briefly annotated [list](/readinglist.html).
