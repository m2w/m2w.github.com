        <h2>Hello there, fellow internaut!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        You might well be wondering to whom this digital abode belongs.<br>

        Fear not, I shall enlighten you! My name is Moritz. I love traveling and programming. Currently I am combining both; living in Japan for a year on a working-holiday visa. I get to travel around, working on various side-projects when I have had enough sightseeing. Programming is my passion and, back home, where I am finishing a master in computer science and business, it is also my day-job.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learning new things holds a strange fascination for me, as does discovering new places and experiencing different cultures. Hence, I enjoy learning new programming languages (especially functional ones), concepts, technologies and traveling.

    <p>
        What is this then? <br>
        
        This is my personal blog. Here you can read my ramblings, musings and write-ups (aka. tutorials) on technical and not-so-technical topics.

    <h3>Some opinionated tidbits about me:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Currently my favorite programming languages are <em>Erlang</em> and <em>Clojure</em>.</li>

        <li>I enjoy developing backends for web applications.</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/basho/webmachine">Webmachine's</a> approach to web-development<sup><a href="#note1" id="note1-return">1</a></sup> is the propper way.</li>

        <li>Emacs is the one true editor, although I prefer Sublime Text for frontend stuff.</li>

        <li>Conceptual knowledge is far more valuable than procedural knowledge.<sup><a href="#note2" id="note2-return">2</a></sup></li>

        <li>Learn through understanding, not rote.</li>

        <li>Polyglot development is the future.</li>

        <li>Git all the things!</li>

        <li>Documentation is a first-class citizen.</li>

        <li>A REPL beautifully complements testing.</li>

        <li>Nothing is ever set in stone.</li>

        <li>Broadening one's horizon can only occur by leaving one's comfort zone.</li>

        <li>Memories (good and bad) are the most precious resource you have.</li>

        <li>Nothing stings like, and for as long as, regret - so just-do-it&trade;.</li>

        <li>A healthy dose of paranoia goes a long way to protect your privacy.</li>
    </ul>

            <li id="note2">Knowledge of underlying concepts is "portable". Procedural knowledge on the other hand is (for 95% of the problems I run into) just a google search away and usually far more restricted in applicable scope.<a href="#note2-return">&#8617;</a></li>
