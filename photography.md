##My photography setup

I do most of my shooting with a [D7000](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d7000/) and the non-stabalized [Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8](http://www.tamron.com/en/photolens/di_II_hi_speed/a16.html). This setup is surprisingly light-weight and incredibly versitile.

Additionally I own a [Nikkor 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 VR](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/zoom/telephotozoom/af-s_vr_zoom70-300mmf_45-56g_if/index.htm), which is a spectacular lens, but is less suited to my typical use-case, which is travel photography.

The hardware is completed by two Hoya filters, a [UV Filter](http://www.hoyafilter.com/hoya/products/hdfilters/hdfilteruv/) for the 17-50mm and a [Protector](http://www.hoyafilter.com/hoya/products/hdfilters/hdfilterprotector/) for the 70-300mm.

Maintenance and cleaning is done with a Zeiss Lens Cleaning Kit and the [Giotto's Super Rocket](http://www.giottos.com/pro_view.aspx?nid=8&typeid=77), which I am a little underwhelmed with.

For dedicated photo-excursions or for suitcase traveling I carry the entire setup in a [Lowepro Fastpack AW 250](http://store.lowepro.com/fastpack-250), which comfortably fits everything. For more adventurous traveling, I usually restrict myself to just one lens and the bare cleaning necessities which fit perfectly into my [Case Logic SLR Zoom Holster](http://www.caselogic.com/en-us/us/products/camera-cases/view-all/slr-zoom-holster-_-slrc_-_201_-_black).

Post production is done in [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) on my MBA.

Overall I am very happy with my current setup. Eventually, I aim to add a dedicated macro lens (my current favorite being the [Nikkor Micro 105mm f/2.8 VR](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/specoalpurpose/micro/af-s_vr_micro-nikkor_105mmf_28_if/index.htm)), a decent uni- or tripod and the [Nik Collection](http://www.google.com/nikcollection/).

##My workflow

Generally, I tend to either overshoot or undershoot heavily. Undershooting is something I am still working on, there are a number of times I retrospectively wish I had taken pictures, it is mostly a question of motivation. Overshooting, however, is something that Aperture allows me to fix quickly.

After a session (which might last for a couple of days, if I'm on a hike for example), I import all new RAWs into Aperture. To conserve precious hard-drive space on my MBA, I only work with referenced originals, unless I am on a really long trip without access to my NAS and don't carry enough SD cards to last me for the rest of the trip. On the NAS all originals are stored in RAID1 and are organized in the standard `/year/month/day` folder hierarchy.

During the import procedure, I let Aperture automatically split the photos into separate projects, this generally works as expected and makes it easier to place individual photos during the next phase. After the import I verify that none of the RAWs were corrupted during the procedure before wiping the SD cards. The imported project(s) then move into my 'inbox' folder.

I have a total of three folders that assist with organization: the 'inbox' contains all projects that have not been 'rated', 'post-prod' contains those projects that are awaiting post production and 'finalized' is self-explanatory.

During 'rate and reject', which is done in preview mode and image by image, I flat-out reject any image that doesn't seem appealing in terms of framing, composition or mood along with other obvious defaults, notably heavy overexposure and blur. My own guidelines for the rating of images are rather vague:

+ *1 star*: acceptable image, something that I can keep as a memory and possibly to show family
+ *2 stars*: decent image, this is something I can show both family and friends
+ *3 stars*: good image, either framing, composition or mood is good enough to outweigh other defaults
+ *4 stars*: great image, where both subject and technique just seem 'right'
+ *5 stars*: exceptional image, these have that little something extra

The rating procedure itself can at times be emotional, so I might give an image an additional star simply for being very iconic of a trip or carrying a lot of memory value. During post-production I only touch 3+ stars and only tend to upload 4+ stars to flickr.

Once rated, a project moves into prost-prod, which is usually limited to cropping, realignment, WB- and curve optimization. I usually use the Aperture RGB proofing scheme while making these changes. For images that require it, I add CA correction, noise reduction and sharpening as required. If very obvious, I also try and retouch things such as obvious dust-specs on the image. Finished projects move into the 'finalized' folder.

Generally I make heavy use of filtering to simplify the organization of my images and have a number of smart albums both per project and library-wide. Occasionally I go back and update ratings or meta-data of finalized projects.
