        <h2>An annotated reading list</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Essentially, this is a way for me to track my reading habits along with a short summary of my general impression to facilitate memory. Do note that the links for books and novels are Amazon affiliate links.</p>

    <h3>Belletristic & Non-Fiction:</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>The Guns of August</b> - <small>Barbara W. Tuchman</small></dt>
        <dd>A great read (rare are such well-written and well edited books), offering a fascinating look at the lead up to one of histories darkest periods.</dd>
        <dt><b>Peopleware</b> - <small>Tom DeMarco &amp; Timothy Lister</small></dt>
        <dd>One of the books that regularly gets mentioned in recommend reading lists on HN and proggit; for good reason. There is nothing ground-breaking in it, but it's an easy, eye-opening read.</dd>
        <dt><b>Great North Road</b> - <small>Peter F. Hamilton</small></dt>
        <dd>A gripping Sci-Fi novel set in a realistic future and written by one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors. I had very high expectations and they were more than satisfied.</dd>
        <dt><b>Moonwalking with Einstein</b> - <small>Joshua Foer</small></dt>
        <dd>I stumbled upon this on <a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Personal/Books-I-Read-This-Summer">Bill Gates reading list</a>. It was a fantastical read, filled with insights and curious annecdotes about our memory.</dd>
        <dt><b>Die Sturmk√∂nige Trilogie</b> - <small>Kai Meyer</small></dt>
        <dd>A german fantasy trilogy, complete with a nice and unorthodox universe, with a lot of (partially untapped) potential, that made for fast page-turning.</dd>
        <dt><b>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</b> - <small>Richard Phillips Feynman</small></dt>
        <dd>Enjoyable read with some very quirky and funny stories about one of the great scientific minds of our time. However, to me there was occasionally too much repetition between the chapters, as they can very well be read independently/out of order.</dd>
        <dt><b>The Power of Habit</b> - <small>Charles Duhigg</small></dt>
        <dd>Well written and very immersive, a treasure trove of insights on how to take control of our habits. This is probably the best guide to changing just about every aspect of your life, although it never feels like one.</dd>
        <dt><b>Fermat's Last Theorem</b> - <small>Simon Singh</small></dt>
        <dd>A fascinating topic and its history, written so that even laymen can understand it. Personally I felt it was a little too superficial (simplified might be the better word), I would have loved more historical details or more discussion of the consequences of some of the mentioned discoveries.</dd>
        <dt><b>In God's House</b> - <small>Ray Mouton</small></dt>
        <dd>A scary, vivid and shocking account of the trial that led to the uncovering of the systematic abuse and cover-up of abuse in the catholic church. In the words of Sue Blaine: "the extent of the rot is awe-inspiring". This is one of the few books that evokes real emotions while reading.</dd>
        <dt><b>The Lost World</b> - <small>Arthur Conan Doyle</small></dt>
        <dd>Fast paced with plenty of action. In short a great classic.</dd>
        <dt><b>The Importance of Being Earnest</b> - <small>Oscar Wilde</small></dt>
        <dd>Humorous and witty, it is not without reason Wilde's most popular play.</dd>
        <dt><b>Still Missing</b> - <small>Chevy Stevens</small></dt>
        <dd>A shocking and very emotional (literally) thriller, written in an unusual style that allows for a very different kind of storytelling.</dd>
