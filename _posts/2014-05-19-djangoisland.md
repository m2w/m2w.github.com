DjangoConfEU, #djangoisland, ended last Saturday. I have my boss to
thank for sponsoring the trip. The ÃŽle des Embiez off the southern
coast of France was a wonderful choice of a location.

The location itself was stunning. And we had the fortune of blue skies
for the duration of the conference with the mediterranean temperatures
offset by a wonderful breeze. Taking a stroll around the island was a
very rewarding experience, with multiple small beaches to enjoy and a
rather monstrous goat to be seen - its size and huge horns had become
rather infamous by the end of the conference.

The conference started with three days of talks and without going into
too much detail - all talks were recorded - the quality was incredibly
high. A few stood out from the rest:

- [@mjtamlyn](https://twitter.com/mjtamlyn)'s talk on
  `django.contrib.postgres`, which gave a concise overview of the
  coming enhancements for Django-PostgreSQL integration
- [@aymericaugustin](https://twitter.com/aymericaugustin)'s keynote on
  "Where the wild things are", detailing the changes to app loading
  coming with `1.7`
- [@jacobburch](https://twitter.com/jacobburch) &
  [@jacobian](https://twitter.com/jacobian)'s talk on
  removing/replacing individual components of Django
- [@idangazit](https://twitter.com/idangazit)'s talk on "Advanced Web
  Topography"; a visually very pleasing introduction to, and overview of,
  topography on the web
- [@amjithr](https://twitter.com/amjithr)'s "Introduction to docker",
  a quick, yet thorough introduction to docker, and his amazing
  one-handed typing speed ;)
- [@Xof](https://twitter.com/Xof)'s talk on "Really, Really Fast
  Django", which gave an overview of strategies to speed up Django,
  through caching, caching, oh and also caching
- Finally, and this gets my vote for best talk,
  [@evildmp](https://twitter.com/evildmp)'s keynote on "The
  programmer's body", a beautiful and philosophical talk on diversity
  in our industry.

For detailed descriptions of all talks, I highly recommend
[@reinoutvanrees](https://twitter.com/reinoutvanrees) awesome
[talk-by-talk summaries](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/tags/djangocon.html).

Overall, I learned a lot of things from the talks and took home a long list
of libraries to review and adopt. For example:

- [hospital](http://hospital.readthedocs.org)
- [structlog](http://www.structlog.org/)
- [riemann](http://riemann.io/)
- [oscar](http://oscarcommerce.com/)
- [play it again Sam](https://github.com/rfk/playitagainsam)
- [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/)
- and many, many more

The sprints were great fun. I got my first commit into Django and
really enjoyed the 'getting things done' atmosphere that was
palpable throughout the two days of sprinting. It was infectious.

Even if Django wasn't a viable choice of framework (which it
certainly is), its community alone would be worth sticking with
it. Far from being limited to Europeans, #djangoisland drew
participants from all over the world. The fact, that all participants
were quartered in the same hotel, had the beautiful effect of having
everyone eating together three times a day. This made meeting and
interacting much more natural and prevented the kind of clustering
that frequently occurs otherwise. Equally, the wide variety of the
participants' backgrounds made for very diverse and interesting
conversations that frequently lasted (way too) late into the
night. The wonderful food certainly helped too. On the topic of
catering, I think most participants would agree that the food was
excellent.

I am looking forward to next year in Cardiff!
