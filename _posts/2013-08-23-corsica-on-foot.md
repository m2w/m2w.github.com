Corsica is a rocky island in the Mediterranean Sea. It has the expected Mediterranean flair, with beautiful beaches, deep blue water, amazing food and a very friendly and hospitable people. It is also known for the GR20, one of the more difficult and spectacular Grande Randonées.

Corsica, however, also offers a number of lesser known, but beautiful hiking trails. Of these, I just completed the first half of the _mare a mare nord_, from Moriani Plage to Corte, and, at the recommendation of a very nice French couple we met on the trail, parts of the _mare e monti_ through the Scandola Nature Reserve.

Both trails had their fair share of challenges, notably intense heat, but rewarded with stunning vistas of the barren, rocky and not-quite-but-almost desolate Corsican landscape. To those seeking a rewarding hiking experience with a little less 'crowding' than the GR20, the chance to meet some very interesting people and the prospect of ending the journey on a beach I cannot recommend either trail enough. The locals we encountered during the trek were all extremely friendly (though some were a little rough around the edges) and we had some very memorable chats with fellow hikers.

A few words of advice: Inland Corsica is a rather desolate place. Despite the multitude of villages that dot the northern half of the island, most are in a more or less advanced stage of abandonment. This means that you will struggle to find places to resupply outside the major cities. So you have to prepare accordingly if you are on a tight budget and cannot afford the ~50€ price tag for semi-pension at the Gîtes d'étape. Many Gîtes are reservation-only!  Almost every village has its own public fountain and you should aim to carry at least 2 liters on you to last you the distance between the fountains. Another notable point is that, especially in the more rural areas, you won't get very far without speaking a bare minimum of French. Lastly, one of the most pressing issues that we shared with many of the other hikers we met on the trails is that acceptance of cards (of any kind) outside the large touristic cities is pretty much non-existent and finding an <abbr>ATM</abbr> or other means of withdrawing cash is nigh impossible. So I recommend that you stock up on cash whenever you can.

Hiking in Corsica is amazing. The trails are marked very regularly and prominently. There are plenty of Gîtes, so that it is possible to set your own pace for the trails. You might get to meet some really nice people.
