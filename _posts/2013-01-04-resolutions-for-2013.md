My (programming) resolutions for 2013:

+ blog regularly &#8658; aim for 1 technical and 1 non-technical post every month
+ attend 2 conferences
+ attend as many meetups as possible
+ read at least 2 compsci papers every month
+ finally complete and publish all side projects that have been bit-rotting away at an "almost complete, but not quite release-ready" state
+ `lists:map(fun(L) -> write_side_project_in(L) end, [Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, Objective-C])`.
+ launch at least 1 web app that generates regular revenue
+ learn Japanese
+ actively participate in open source projects
+ improve emacs finger-memory
