I wrote the following 'on the road', after the first day of a hike around the KÃ¶nigssee. As it turned out, the trek that we picked was a little more challenging and the weather a little worse than expected and we didn't touch the laptops for the remainder of the hike. I still believe that the concept of code-hiking is very enticing, but requires very careful planing. If you have done something similar before, I would love to hear about it!

Code-hiking, as its name implies, combines hiking and programming. It leverages the amazing infrastructure available throughout southern Germany and the Alps to spend the days scaling the mountains, enjoying the breath-taking views and fresh air and spending the evenings hacking on projects.

The [DAV](http://www.alpenverein.de/) (German only) maintains shelters and refuges throughout the alps. These let you charge your laptop over night. They also provide a certain level of comfort that sleeping in a tent just cannot. For obvious reasons the hacking sessions end up rather short, so far we managed about 1-2 hours every evening, but are incredibly productive.

The hiking provides plenty of time to discuss and mull over challenges and problems regarding the project at hand. There is nothing more rewarding than reaching the daily destination after a strenuous hike, organizing your place to sleep, taking care of the equipment and getting together for a well-deserved dinner. After dinner it's time to find a power socket, a place to hunker down and get coding. There are none of the traditional distractions, no HN or reddit, no TV.

While you are rarely alone in the shelters on weekends, it is usually not hard to find a secluded spot. In the case that it is a little crowded, people will still respect your desire for privacy. Next comes the easy part, open up your local copy of the documentation along with your favorite editor and get coding. Once the exhaustion finally does set in, it's time for a final cup of tea and some reading/talking with the fellow hikers.

Code-hiking is very flexible: in the alps you can schedule anything between 15 and 30km across terrain of varying difficulty between refuges. This allows you to pace yourself depending on whether the focus is hiking or coding. It also comes with the additional benefit of being relatively cheap in terms of accommodation and travel costs.
