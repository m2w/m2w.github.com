Happy New Year everyone! I hope it will be a fruitful year for all of
us. My resolutions for this year:

- Spend 2 weeks trekking in a country I haven't visited before
- Get my driver's license
- Have 15 open source projects on github
- Swim 3km in under 2hrs
- Attend 10 networking events or conferences
- Write 12 blog posts
- Read 3 books on modern German politics
- Read 7 biographies of notable states- and business(wo)men
- Publish an Android app
- Spend more time reading (books) than gaming
- Create something that solves a 'big problem'
- Have one project with at least 20 stars on github
- Attain B1 proficiency in Japanese

To avoid falling into the similar pitfalls as last year, I am trying a new
approach: a focus on the overall and less on time-bound achievement.

I wish you the best resolve with your own resolutions!
