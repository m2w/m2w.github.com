Happy New Year everyone! I hope it will be a fruitful year for all of us. My resolutions for this year:

- spend 2 weeks trekking in a country I haven't visited before
- get my driver's licence
- 15 open source projects on github
- swim 3km in under 2hrs
- attend 10 networking events or conferences
- publish 12 blog posts
- read 3 books on modern German politics
- read 7 biographies of notable states- and business(wo)men
- publish an android app
- spend more time reading (books) than gaming
- create something that solves a 'big problem'
- have one project with at least 20 stars on github
- reach B1 in Japanese

To prevent falling into the same trap as last year I am trying a new approach: a focus on the overall and less on time-bound achievement.

I wish you the best resolve with your own resolutions!
