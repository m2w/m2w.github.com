The southern Kungsleden runs from Storlien to Sälen, in close
proximity to the Swedish-Norwegian border. It is far less traveled
than its northern counterpart, but is said to offer equally stunning
landscapes and vistas - and stunning they were.

We spent 12 days hiking from Storlien to Grövelsjön and another 4 days
exploring the Norwegian Fjäll west of Grövelsjön. Overall, we hiked
close to 300km. You can find some impressions on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tibidat/sets/72157648195185822/).

We were incredibly lucky with the weather. The worst we encountered
was a short-lived drizzle; even the mosquitoes seemed to leave us
alone most of the time!

It has only been one week since, but I could already return for
another round of hiking. The Fjäll has been different from all my
previous hiking experiences, with the
[Allemansrätten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam)
offering a hitherto unexperienced kind of freedom. Additionally, the
Swedes were incredibly friendly and even in the remotest corners
everyone spoke fluent English. Surprisingly, a number of Swedes we met
also spoke German.

Most of the people we encountered were regulars and, after our
experiences, it is easy to see why. Next time, and there will be a
next time, I aim to head further north into even more remote areas.
