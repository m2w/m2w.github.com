After a first brush with Scala during the Stripe CTF earlier this year, I have have been trying to find an opportunity to dive deeper. Yesterday saw a post about [delete.im](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7345449). Cloning their basic functionality seemed like a neat project to test out some of the cool Scala libraries I have stumbled upon. Notably [spray](http://spray.io) and [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/).

While getting started I ran into a couple of issues with dependencies in eclipse. The following `sbt` commands will fix these for you:

{% highlight bash %}
> reload
> eclipse with-source=true
{% endhighlight %}

I am still very far from groking Scala, but so far it has been a pretty nice experience. You can track my progress on [github](https://github.com/m2w/ephemeral).
