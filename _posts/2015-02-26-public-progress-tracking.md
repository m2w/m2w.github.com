In a bid to hold myself more accountable with regards to meeting my
goals, I decided to [publicize](/tracker.html) progress towards my
resolutions for the year.

Ultimately, my aim is to make most goal-setting and planning
public/transparent. I hope that this will help me become (more)
diligent keeping deadlines for those things that I'm not as excited
about.

Syncing the live TODO lists and a static blog will be an interesting
challenge and should provide a fun task to write a first plugin for
[ivy](https://github.com/m2w/ivy). More on ivy soon :-)
