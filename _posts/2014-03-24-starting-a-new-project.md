I recently stumbled across an [amazing blog post on logging](http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying) by Jay Kreps of LinkedIn. Beside being extremely well written and informative, it got me really interested in building an application to try out some of the technologies at the heart of 'scaling'.

The plan is to (finally) complete the [erli](https://github.com/m2w/erli) rewrite and combine its functionality with that of [ephemeral](https://github.com/m2w/ephemeral). The output will be an application that allows (anonymous) users to create secret notes. I want the stored notes to be server-side encrypted. My current idea is to generate two URLs for each note, one pointing to the note and the other being used as key to encrypt the data. Since there is no session state or other connection between a note and a key URL (as key URLs could be generated ahead of time or on the client side) this should provide 'good enough' secrecy.

Both URLs are subject to expiry, so if you want your note to expire after one view, both the note and key URL are each only available for only one view. Upon expiry, the relevant database contents are erased and the URL will return a `410`.

This is the core functionality of the application and should be a pretty fun exercise. In addition, I would like to add a [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and [hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) to provide an activity feed and provide simple statistics and aggregates regarding service usage.

Ideally, the whole application should be docker based, to facilitate testing and experimenting with 'scale'. I code-named the project 'HÅ“nir', after the god of silence in Norse mythology.
