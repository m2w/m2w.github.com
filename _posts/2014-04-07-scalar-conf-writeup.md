_TLDR:_ Scalar Conf was amazing!

The Warszawa-Berlin-Express will take just over 5.5hrs to get me back to my home-country, plenty of time to review Scalar Conf!

Scalar Conf started early, really early. Registration opened at 8 and
when I arrived at 7:45 there were already a number of people lined
up. Registration itself was quick and uncomplicated. After joining the
circle of people with name tags, I got to enjoy some free breakfast,
compliments of the sponsors. Initially I was a little insecure,
seeing as everyone seemed to already know each other and I didn't
find any groups speaking English.

The conference took place at the Bibliotek Narodowa and the sessions
were held inside its auditorium, which I estimate to hold about
200-250 people. The seats were actually really comfortable! There was
free WiFi from the beginning, but once the place filled up, connection
speeds dropped drastically. I was actually unable to maintain my
<abbr>VPN</abbr> session and so only went online to fire off the
occasional tweet.

At 8:50 the sessions started. The first session by
[@stefanzeiger](https://twitter.com/stefanzeiger), an introduction to
slick, was great start and set a high bar for the remainder of the
conference.

The morning sessions were a blur of awesome:

- Type algorithmic with [@propensive](https://twitter.com/propensive)
  was actually really cool
- A great introduction to spray by
  [@adamwarski](https://twitter.com/adamwarski)
- React with Scala.js by
  [@matthiasnehlsen](https://twitter.com/matthiasnehlsen)

By lunch, I felt as though I could spend the rest of the month just
reading up on the projects/topics presented.

Lunch was a little messy. But then, having 200+ people converge on a
cafeteria made for 50 is always going to be a challenge. The
organizers handled it really well, and even though the lunch break had
to be extended, the impact on the schedule was negligible. Lunch
itself was simply amazing. I had no idea that cafeteria food could be
so good (and cheap). Huge kudos to the cafeteria staff!

After lunch, the sessions resumed at the high level I had come to
expect - with just one exception where one of the examples was
inappropriate and of rather bad taste.

I especially enjoyed [@ktosopl](https://twitter.com/ktosopl)'s session
on akka-persistance, the tour of Scala's dark side with
[@tnurkiewicz](https://twitter.com/tnurkiewicz) and the talk on macro
based type providers by [@xeno_by](https://twitter.com/xeno_by) and
[@travisbrown](https://twitter.com/travisbrown) (who in my book would
also get the award for best speaker).

The real highlights of the afternoon sessions were the comparison of
lambdas in Java 8 and Scala by
[@gkossakowski](https://twitter.com/gkossakowski) and
[@lkuczera](https://twitter.com/lkuczera)'s talk on scalaz.

Once the sessions finished, the majority of people headed off to join
the after-party, which was held at a really nice bar/restaurant
nearby: Time for more talking, really strong polish beer
(9.8% alc!) and awesome grilled food.

When it was eventually time for me to head back to my hostel, I did so
with the certainty that I had attended an amazing event and met some
really cool people. I can only hope that there will be another Scalar
Conf next year.

Even if it should loose some of its lustre in the aftermath of Java 8,
Scala has an amazing community and that alone should be worth checking
it out.

Lastly, Warsaw was a really nice location for a conference (although
not quite as accessible as some other European metropoles) and is well
worth sparing a day for sightseeing.
