After recent hikes and in preparation for upcoming hikes, I compiled a
little list of bare necessities. It should be adapted to the suit
climatic demands of the destination:

+ 2 sets of base-layer clothing
+ 1 mid-layer
+ 1 soft- or hard-shell depending on the expected weather conditions
+ Hiking pants and waterproof pants if expecting rain
+ A pair of gloves
+ A buff
+ 3 pairs of hiking socks
+ A pair of broken-in hiking boots
+ A hat against the sun
+ An insulating mattress
+ A microfibre towel
+ A head-torch
+ A kindle ;)
+ A mechanical or chemical water filtration system
+ A well equipped first aid kit
+ A tent
+ A sleeping bag with inlet
+ A hiking backpack with a waterproof liner
+ A camping chair or sitting cushion
+ A camping gas powered cooker and crockery (at least 1 spork and 1
  pot)
+ An neigh indestructible water bottle
+ Required map(s) and/or guides
+ A decent sized knife
+ A minimalistic set of toiletries (make sure to include earplugs,
  sunscreen and toilet paper)
+ Dedicated, waterproof bags for your valuables and your sleeping bag
+ One day's worth of emergency rations
+ A small notebook and pen
+ A camera
+ Trekking poles
+ About 5m of rope
+ Spare, tough rubbish bags

A couple of accompanying remarks:

+ Aim for under 12kg total, unless you are going on an expedition
+ Soap and shampoo-free works surprisingly well, you will have to deal
  with about  a week of 'transition time' though
+ Merino beats just about any other material with regards to odor and
  long-term comfort
+ Zip-off pants can be very incredibly
+ Socks are the second most important part of your kit. Really good
  socks offer incomparable comfort and hygiene.
+ As long as it's wind- and waterproof, a lighter tent is always the
  better choice, but especially during very wet conditions additional
  space in the tent is much more valuable than saved weight
+ Silk inlets are amazing for sleep comfort.
+ A camping chair might seem like unnecessary comfort - it is - but
  the amount of comfort per gram that it offers after a long hike is
  incredible
