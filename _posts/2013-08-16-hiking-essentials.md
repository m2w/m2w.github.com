After recent hikes and in preparation for upcoming hikes, I compiled a little list of bare necessities. It should be adapted to the climatic demands of the destination:

+ 2 sets of clothing (base-layer, hiking shirt and pants), so only 1 spare!
+ 3 pairs of hiking socks
+ A pair of broken-in hiking boots
+ A hat against the sun
+ An inflatable camping matress
+ A micro-fibre towel
+ A head-torch
+ A kindle ;)
+ A decent first aid kit
+ Something against the chill at night and something against rain
+ A tent
+ A sleeping bag with inlet
+ A hiking backpack with waterproof cover
+ A camping chair
+ A camping gas powered cooker and crockery (at least 1 spork and 1 pot)
+ Required map(s) and/or guides
+ A minimalistic set of toiletries (make sure to include earplugs, sunscreen and toilet paper)
+ A 100% waterproof bag
+ One day's worth of emergency rations
+ A small notebook and pen
+ A camera

A couple of accompanying remarks:

+ Aim for under 12kg total, unless you are going on an expedition.
+ Investing in either merino or synthetic base-layer is worth every cent.
+ Zip-off pants are incredibly versitile.
+ Socks are the second most important part of your kit. Really good socks offer incomparable comfort and hygene.
+ As long as it's wind- and waterproof, a lighter tent is always the better choice.
+ Silk inlets are amazing for sleep comfort.
+ A camping chair might seem like unnecessary comfort - it is - but the amount of comfort per gram that it offers after a long hike is incredible
