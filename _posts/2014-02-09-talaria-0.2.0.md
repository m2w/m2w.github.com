I just pushed version *0.2.0* of _talaria_ to [github](https://github.com/m2w/talaria). It marks a transition to a more configurable and modular design. It now uses the module pattern to encapsulate the logic and lets users set the necessary (and optional) config parameters without having to modify the actual _talaria_ sources. Now all that is necessary to use and configure _talaria_ is including the script itself and then call:

{% highlight js %}
talaria.init({REPOSITORY_NAME: 'm2w.github.com', GITHUB_USERNAME: 'm2w'});
{% endhighlight %}

One of the things I am still looking into is using [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) to make _talaria_ requirejs ready and even further improve re-usability. Once the new design is finalized it will be ready for registration on the bower index.
