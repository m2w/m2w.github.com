title: On getting robbed
tags: []
---

I was robbed over the weekend. Phone and wallet - both gone. In
this day and age that is considerable inconvenience.

The phone is my primary means of offline communication and, thanks to
Google Authenticator, also a critical component of my digital life as
a whole. Additionally, suddenly being broke is rather upsetting.

Overall it could have been much worse. And while the financial loss
hurt, my phone was fully encrypted and I managed to lock all cards
before anything fishy could happen. It did make me feel rather
vulnerable and was a considerable hassle to get everything back in
order[^1]. I really have to thank my brother, for generally being
awesome and just being a huge help throughout this mess.

So I thought I should share some general advice on how to prepare
yourself for a similar situation:

- Keep some cash at home. This will allow you to cover unexpected
  expenses or fees that might result from your situation and keep the
  fridge stocked.
- Keep photocopies of your most important documents.
- Having a secondary wallet can be a huge boon.
- Encrypt everything! Especially your phone! Unfortunately, encryption
  is a double edge sword. On the one hand it means your data is safe,
  on the other it lowers the chances of recovering your stolen
  equipment to near zero (since the thief will never be able to
  actually boot it back up)
- Ensure you keep a record of important numbers, such as debit card
  numbers, credit card numbers, passport numbers and your phone's
  IMEI. In Germany these kind of details are required for the police
  report.
- Have a secondary phone or Skype account with credit available.
- Keep a short checklist for theft-related vulnerabilities. Examples
  are: a list of cards to lock/block, procedure to remote wipe your phone,
  alternative access to 2FA protected services, secondary means of
  communication
- Make sure you are aware of if and what kind of damages your
  insurance might cover and how long your claim window is.

The most important thing is to stay calm. Just remember: in the end it
is just money. All of the people that helped me to get things back
in order were incredibly understanding and really friendly.

[^1]: Basically, you will have to lock all your banking related cards and wait for new cards and PINs, lock your <abbr>SIM</abbr> and order a new one, lock any other cards you might have (e.g. gym membership, public transit, etc.), fill out a police report and get your driver's license and ID reissued.
